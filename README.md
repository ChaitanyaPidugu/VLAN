Project Name:
VLAN Configuration and Network Traffic Monitoring using Port Mirroring

Project Summary:
This project focuses on configuring Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) and implementing port mirroring on a network switch. Using a Linux machine with Netplan, multiple VLANs were created, and the system was configured as a "one-armed router" to route traffic between VLANs on different subnets. Port mirroring was set up to replicate inbound and outbound traffic from the primary port (connected to the Linux machine) to a monitoring port, allowing traffic analysis with Wireshark. The project captured and analyzed both normal and DHCP network traffic, aiding in network diagnostics and troubleshooting.
